      <h1>Evan Zelt</h1>
                <p> I'm a CS major in my senior year at <a href="https://cs.wfu.edu/">Wake Forest University</a>. I will be attending the <a href="https://school.wakehealth.edu">Wake Forest School of Medicine</a> starting in 2025. I am an avid skier and sailor. My main interests are medicine, computer science, and mathematics.</p>

      <p>You can reach me at my <a href="mailto:zeltep21@wfu.edu">email</a> or find out what I'm working on via my <a href="https://github.com/zeltep">Github</a></p>

      <h2>Cellular Automata</h2>
                <p>Given my interests in medicine/biology and computer science, I have always been fascinated at the concept of cellular automata. Specifically, the ability of complex behaviors and patterns to emerge from simple rules. To me, this phenomenon is the perfect mixture of philosophy, biology, and CS. Some interesting studies of cellular automata in action include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5zz86hHNFk">slime molds</a>. Conway's Game has intrigued so much that I have taken up playing the ancient game of <cite>Go</cite> (due to the parallels between the two), which I strongly recommend playing as you can <a href="https://online-go.com/learn-to-play-go">here</a>.
                <p>I have created a simple automata example which you can view <a href="/automata.html">here</a></p>
